# remarkable_mouse

Use your reMarkable as a graphics tablet.

Special thanks to [canselcik](https://github.com/canselcik/libremarkable) and [LinusCDE](https://github.com/LinusCDE/rmWacomToMouse) for inspiration.

# Quick Start

On the host machine with the tablet plugged in via USB:

``` bash
pip install remarkable-mouse
remouse
```

By default, `10.11.99.1` is used as the address.  Find your password in the reMarkable's [settings menu](https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh).  If you are on Linux using X11, you can use the `--evdev` option for pressure support.
If you are on Windows, you can use the `--pen` option for pressure support.

The monitor that the tablet will output to is dynamically changed to the one that the mouse is in. To output to only one monitor, use the `--monitor` flag.

To use the `--region` flag, you may need to install the `python3-tk` or `python3-tkinter` package with your package manager.

# Examples

specify monitor, orientation, password

``` bash
remouse --orientation right --mode fit --monitor 1 --password foobar
```

passwordless login

``` bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/remarkable -N ''
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/remarkable.pub root@10.11.99.1
remouse
```

running with pressure sensitivity (Linux only)

``` bash
sudo --preserve-env=USER,PATH env remouse --evdev
```

# Usage

```
usage: remouse [-h] [--debug] [--key PATH] [--password PASSWORD] [--address ADDRESS] [--mode {fit,fill,stretch}] [--orientation {top,left,right,bottom}] [--monitor NUM] [--region]
               [--threshold THRESH] [--evdev] [--pen]

use reMarkable tablet as a mouse input

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug               enable debug messages
  --key PATH            ssh private key
  --password PASSWORD   ssh password
  --address ADDRESS     device address
  --mode {fit,fill,stretch}
                        Scale setting. Fit (default): take up the entire tablet, but not necessarily the entire monitor. Fill: take up the entire monitor, but not necessarily the entire
                        tablet. Stretch: take up both the entire tablet and monitor, but don't maintain aspect ratio.
  --orientation {top,left,right,bottom}
                        position of tablet buttons
  --monitor NUM         override automatic monitor selection
  --region              Use a GUI to position the output area. Overrides --monitor and automatic monitor selection
  --threshold THRESH    stylus pressure threshold (default 600)
  --evdev               use evdev to support pen pressure (requires root, Linux only)
  --pen                 use pen input to support pen pressure in windows
```
